# Unit Converter

Simple unit conversion app developed in Python.
Uses the Pint library to make the conversions easier and this project can focus on creating a UI for this library.

I would have created the conversion logic myself had it not been that it would've been redundant anyway with Pint available. Converting units is easy as it just requires basic mathematics. It would be another challenge in itself to use that library into an all in one Unit Converter app with a UI for users which is what I would like to develop.


## Console Application

- First iteration will have all inputs made inside a console

## Final Product

The vision for this application is that it should have a user friendly UI instead of having to type things into the console. I have yet to touch anything about python UI libraries so that will be fun to learn.
